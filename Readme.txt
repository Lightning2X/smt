To build the game:
1. Go to file tab on the top left.
2. Choose build and run at the bottom.

You can start multiple clients to test out hosting:
In the Level1 scene, set the ip address in the networkmanager to the ip that you want to connect to. (127.0.0.1 if you want to test both on the local pc)
Run the build and choose server or host
Run another instance of the build and choose client instead.
(Can of course also be used in the editor)
