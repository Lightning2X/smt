https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/netcode/current/about

To build the game:
1. Go to file tab on the top left.
2. Choose build and run at the bottom.

You can start multiple clients to test out hosting:
Run the build and choose server or host (Host is also a player, which we will probably use)
Run another instance of the build and choose client instead.
(Can of course also be used in the editor)
